# ðŸ§  Contextual Customer Support Chatbot (RAG-based)

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based **Contextual Customer Support Chatbot** designed to deliver **instant, accurate, and context-aware responses** to customer queries related to products and FAQs.

It integrates **FAISS vector search** for fast semantic retrieval and **LLaMA 3** (via **Ollama**) for natural language response generation, all served through an intuitive **Streamlit web interface**.  
The chatbot effectively reduces repetitive customer support queries by automating common responses with citations and context.
